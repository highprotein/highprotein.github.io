# 📦 Dropship Simulator: The Dark Side of E-Commerce

**A satirical browser-based simulation game that explores the unethical mechanics ("Dark Patterns") behind modern dropshipping businesses.**

---

## 📖 About The Project

This project is an interactive educational simulation designed to demonstrate how online sellers manipulate algorithms and customer psychology. Inspired by games like *BitLife*, players manage a dropshipping store for 30 days (and beyond).

The core loop forces players to make a daily choice:
* **Be Ethical:** Honest descriptions and fair prices (Result: Low visibility, slow growth).
* **Be Immoral:** Use "Dark Patterns" like fake countdowns, hidden subscriptions, and bot reviews (Result: High profit, high risk).

## 🎮 Key Features

### 1. The "BitLife" Simulation Engine
* **Manual Progression:** A "Next Day" button drives the game loop.
* **Dynamic Stats:** Manage three competing metrics:
    * 💰 **Bank Balance:** Don't go bankrupt.
    * 📈 **Algorithm Trust:** How much the platform promotes you.
    * 🛡️ **Reputation:** Your integrity and safety from bans.

### 2. Product Scenarios & Dilemmas
The game features unique events based on your inventory choice:
* **🎧 Headphones:** Choose between honest specs or "Keyword Stuffing."
* **💊 Paracetamol:** Decide whether to sell expired stock as "Vintage."
* **🔌 USB Cables:** Use "Bait & Switch" tactics on cable length.
* **💨 Hairdryers:** Fake "CE" safety certifications to save costs.

### 3. "Dark Pattern" Minigames
When players choose an unethical path, they must complete fast-paced minigames that gamify manipulation:
* **The Label Scratcher:** Frantically scratch off expiry dates.
* **Keyword Catcher:** Catch spam buzzwords to trick the search engine.
* **Price Pumper:** Manipulate price anchors to create fake discounts.
* **Rank Defender:** Fight against competitors to keep your "Sponsored" slot.

### 4. Endless Mode
If you survive the first 30 days, the game opens up into an infinite mode with generic business events (Tax Audits, Server Crashes, Influencer blackmail), ensuring no two playthroughs are exactly the same.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Responsive grid layout and custom UI styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** No frameworks used.
    * Custom Event System.
    * Canvas API for Minigames and Graphing.
    * Local State Management for game progression.

## 💡 Educational Goal

This game serves as a critique of the "Get Rich Quick" dropshipping culture. By putting the player in the shoes of the seller, it highlights how financial pressure incentivizes:
* **Roach Motel UI:** Making it hard to cancel/return.
* **Social Proofing:** Using fake reviews.
* **Urgency:** Fake countdown timers.
